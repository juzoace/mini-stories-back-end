  mini-stories GitHub project is a tool designed to help users create, edit, and
  share short stories with the world. It helps users to easily create stories
  with a simple, intuitive user interface. The files included in the project
  give users the ability to customize their stories with HTML, CSS, and
  JavaScript. Additionally, the project also provides authentication and
  authorization capabilities to ensure users' stories remain private. It is a
  valuable asset for any user looking to expand their creative writing skills
  while connecting with other writers. 🔮 Feautres Distinctive Features
  User-Centered Design: The mini-stories project is designed to provide a
  user-friendly platform for users to share stories and collaborate on projects.
  This is evident from the variety of views and templates available in the
  project's code. From the "welcome" page with its simple layout and login form,
  to the "dashboard" page with its more intricate design, the project includes
  different elements that cater to the user's experience. Authentication: The
  project includes authentication scripts which allow users to securely log in
  and access their stories. Passport.js is used to authenticate the user, and
  secure session handling is enabled to ensure that all data is kept secure.
  Data Modeling: The project includes models for both the User and Story
  entities. This allows users to create stories and keep track of them, while
  also providing a platform for collaboration. The models are linked to the
  database, allowing for easy retrieval of data. Flexible Layout: The project
  includes multiple templates for displaying stories and other elements on the
  page. This allows for a more varied user experience, with the ability to
  customize the layout to fit the user's needs. Styling: The project includes a
  style.css file which allows for custom styling of the user interface. This
  allows for further customization of the user experience, with the ability to
  adjust colors, font, and other elements to make the project more visually
  appealing. ⚙️ Project Structure repo ├── README.md ├── app.js ├── config │ ├──
